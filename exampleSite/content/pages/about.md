### **What is Decrypted Bytes?**

Decrypted Bytes is a publication focused on creating technical content around different blockchain protocols and products. We aim to create technical content for everyone who is or wants to get involved into the blockchain/web3 industry.

As the web3 industry becomes bigger and bigger, many people will come in with different backgrounds and different understanding of these systems. If someone with a few years of experience comes in and wants to learn, that person might not be looking for how solidity data structure works. We want to fill that issue and create content that suits their level of knowledge.

### **Why are we working on decrypted Bytes?**

Currently, I am the only person working on the publication and writing stuff about things I feel most excited about. There are many things happening everyday in the web3 ecosystem but I think there is not a lot of content around it. That is why I created this publication to write about those things with a technical perspective.

### **Want to write for us?**

If you want to write on Decrypted Bytes on any technical topic around blockchain email me at [hello@decryptedbytes.com](mailto:hello@decryptedbytes.com). If you want to write on topics that cater to a non-technical audience please don’t hesitate to ping about those as well.

**PS**, if you’re on the team of any interesting project and want me to help you write docs or any articles about your protocol or product then ping me at [hello@decryptedbytes.com](mailto:hello@decryptedbytes.com). I am also open for a developer relations position assuming that will allow me to continue working on this publication.
