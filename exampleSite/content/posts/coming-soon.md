## Coming Soon

I am just like you when it comes to side projects. I procrastinated on this project a lot.

Finally, I bought this domain 2-3 days back. I hope now I will start working on writing more stuff. I really want to write about things I find interesting about different blockchain protocols or things I learn about. For example, right now I am interested in learning how to create an execution environment on Celestia and exploring more about MOVE programming language. These are the kinds of things I want to write about.

Web3/Crypto space is filled with great projects that are using blockchain technology in innovative ways and trying to make this space more user friendly. Learning more about these cutting edge technologies gives you insights into what the future will look like future years down the line.

I have a content calendar created on GitHub projects. You can check the content calendar [here](https://github.com/users/decryptedbytes/projects/1). I will try to write an article every 7-10 days.

If you have any new ideas that you want me to explore please email me at [hello@decryptedbytes.com](mailto:hello@decryptedbytes.com) or if you can start a discussion on [GitHub](https://github.com/decryptedbytes/blog/discussions/categories/ideas).

I hope you like the content I like and share it in your network. If you find an issue with my issue, please let me know. If you want you can also contribute to the publication, I specifically didn’t create my personal blog as creating a publication as its own brand will help it to grow independently of me.

I will be writing a series of 10 articles called “Smart Contract with TypeScript” which covers the `near-sdk-js` and testing of those smart contracts.

Why am I covering that? I think allowing developers to create smart contracts with TypeScript can open floodgates to innovation. As there will be more developers experimenting with blockchain with spending time on learning something that they might not be familiar with languages like solidity and rust. We don’t know what will happen with these experiments but we won’t know unless we try, right?
